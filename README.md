# TSAI-EMLO-4.0

ðŸ”¬ EMLOV4 dives deep into the world of MLOps, exploring advanced techniques and tools crucial for success in production environments. From Docker and PyTorch Lightning to AWS and Kubernetes, this course equips you with the knowledge and skills needed to excel in the rapidly evolving field of machine learning operations.

**Note:** Each of the repo may have repo secret and github workflow it was executed in seperate repos. This repo just contains all assignment solutions and they were not executed in this path or this reprository. However all the codes in this repo are executed in `ajithvcoder/emlo4-session-{n}-ajithvcoder` namespace where `n` is the session number. 

Contains solutions for assignments and learning from **Extensive Machine Learning Operations - Version 4.0** course of The School of AI https://theschoolof.ai/#programs

**Important tools, method, configs, links**

- [resource file](./resources/)


## TODO

- Add in bio website with all repo links

## Updates

- Every month end during course development

- There is a [resource file](./resources/) in which i maintain that has concepts and tools which i learnt newly in EMLO-4.0 course.


Thanks to [Satyajit Ghana](https://github.com/satyajitghana)
for this course.

### Note

I really worked very hard to complete each of the assignments.

Thus the course was completed
